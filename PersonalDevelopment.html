<section> 
<h3> Summary of Chapters 4-7 of Twelve Pillars </h3>
<p>
This book features an older character, Charlie, who imparts wisdom to a younger individual, Michael, drawing from the teachings of Mr. Davis. Michael keenly listens to Charlie's advice, evaluating how it can benefit his life and foster personal growth.
<br>
<br><b>Chapter 4 – Achieve Your Goals:</b>
In this section, Charlie emphasizes the primary step in accomplishing goals: putting them in writing. This act not only signifies a genuine desire to achieve one's aspirations but also triggers the process of transforming those goals into concrete realities. By identifying what you wish to accomplish, your mind naturally starts generating ideas and plans to make these goals a reality.
<br>
<br><b>Chapter 5 –The Proper Use of Time:</b>
Charlie advises Michael on becoming the master of his time rather than letting time control him. He emphasizes the idea that each day offers various opportunities, but it's crucial to identify and seize the best opportunity that aligns with your goals. Directing your time and energy toward your most significant opportunities is key to achieving success.
<br>
<br><b>Chapter 6 – Surrounding Yourself with the Best People:</b>
In this chapter, Charlie highlights the importance of surrounding oneself with positive and supportive individuals. He emphasizes how the people you spend your time with can significantly influence your life and emotions. Rather than remaining in the company of those who bring negativity or hinder your progress, Charlie suggests that it's better to be around those who genuinely wish the best for you and inspire you to thrive. Comfort with familiarity isn't always the best choice.
<br>
<br><b>Chapter 7 – Be a Lifelong Learner:</b>
Charlie conveys to Michael that lifelong learning is an essential aspect of success. While formal education is valuable, truly successful individuals are also committed to self-education and continuously expanding their knowledge beyond the classroom. A commitment to ongoing learning and personal growth can have a profound impact on one's future success.

Become the master of my time. Prioritize tasks and allocate time to my most important goals. Identify the best opportunities each day and concentrate my efforts on those that lead to personal and professional growth. 
<br>
<br><b>Surrounding Yourself with Positive Influences:</b>
Because those around you can impact your well-being and aspirations. I should look seek out individuals who encourage and support my personal growth and distance myself from negative influences. 
<br>
<br><b>Be Lifelong Learner: </b>
By exploring new subjects, read books, take courses, and expand my knowledge beyond formal education. By applying the wisdom from "Twelve Pillars" to my life, I can shape a path to success and personal fulfilment.
